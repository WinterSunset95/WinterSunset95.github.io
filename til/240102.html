<h1>How to disable pull-to-refresh on mobile devices</h1>
<p>Dated: 02/01/2024</p>
<div id="intro">
	I was working on <a target="_blank" href="https://wintersunset95.github.io/MyOnlinePhone">MyOnlinePhone</a>
	when I came across this problem, pull-to-refresh was conflicting with the swipe gestures.

	<hr>

	On most mobile devices, when you swipe down, it refreshes the page. This is called pull-to-refresh.
	While being a really handy feature for most websites, it can be a problem for websites that use swipe gestures. <br><br>

	You can use <span style="background-color: var(--accent);">overscroll-behavior: none;</span> to 
	disable pull-to-refresh 

	<pre>
	<code>
html, body {
	overscroll-behavior: none;
}
	</code>
	</pre>

	<hr><br>

	Note that you have to put it on both the <span style="background-color: var(--accent);">html</span> and <span style="background-color: var(--accent);">body</span> elements
	for it to work on all browsers. <br><br>

	You can also use <span style="background-color: var(--accent);">touch-action: none;</span> to disable all touch gestures.
	Although I'm not sure what madman would ever build something that requires this.

	<hr>
	<br>
	<strong>Never</strong> use these as default.
