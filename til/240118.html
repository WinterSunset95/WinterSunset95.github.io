<hr>
<p>
	Well, I hosted my own instance of the <a target="_blank" href="https://consumet.org">consumet</a> API through <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com">vercel</a>.
	Thanks vercel and consumet!!! Learnt a hell lotta new things from them.
</p>
<p>
	So through this api, I built my own streaming platform. I call it <a target="_blank" href="https://svelte-tube.vercel.app">SvelteTube</a>.
	Get it?? XD. Cos it's made with svelte and its for streaming. ha ha ha I am so funny ha ha ha *chokes to death*

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		JavaScript is like the guy from down the street who will let you shoot yourself in the foot.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fuck m3u8

		Svelte is basically JavaScript. But with magic powers
	</li>
	<li>
		SvelteKit is basically Svelte. But with magic powers
	</li>
	<li>
		You cannot break out of the root layout in SvelteKit. It took me 4 HOURS to figure that out
	</li>
	<li>
		PROPER PLANNING IS IMPORTANT
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do I WANT to learn?</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
	<li>The fuck are 'edge functions'?</li>
	<li>I know what serverless functions are. Already used them on NextJs. But how the hell do I implement them in SvelteKit + Vercel????
		Combed through the documentations till I literally felt sick. Nothing
	</li>
	<li>
		How to use websockets with serverless functions
	</li>
	<li>
		My streaming platform is based on an api which scrapes other websites. Where the hell do those sites get THEIR stuff from?
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Whats next?</h2>
<hr>
<p>
	Well for one, I built a streaming/downloading tool using this api and python. I will build this same thing with
	C, Rust and Bash too.
</p>
<p>
	Guess thats all for today... peace!!
