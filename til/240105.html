<h1>Accessing your PHP development server from other devices on the network</h1>

		As I was building my website, I wanted to be able to access it from my phone and tablet to see how it looked on them.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
		I use Archlinux with i3wm as my main OS, and the normal PHP development server to test my code. <br>
		Here's what I did:
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
		First, I found my local IP address with the command:
		<code>
			ifconfig
		</code>
		Output:
		<img class="blog_image" src="https://i.imgur.com/p6VwgFl.png" alt="">
		Look for "inet <ip address>" under "wlo1" (or whatever your network interface is called).
		In my case, it's 192.168.243.51
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
	Go to your project directory and run the PHP development server with the command:
		<code>
			php -S 192.168.243.51:8080
		</code>
		(Note that you need to use your own IP address here, not mine)
		Output:
		<img class="blog_image" src="https://i.imgur.com/iowutrI.png" alt="">
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
		Now, you can access your website from any device on the same network by typing your IP address and port number in the browser.
		<br>
		For example, I can access my website from my phone by typing into the browser:
		<code>
			http://192.168.243.51:8080
		</code>
		Output:
		<img class="blog_image" src="https://i.imgur.com/WmLHoU8.jpg" alt="Image as seen from mobile phone">
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
		And there you have it! You can now access your website from any device on the same network.
