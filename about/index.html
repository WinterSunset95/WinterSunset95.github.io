					<h1>So I am Winter</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>
					Call me Wally. I've been programming since 2020. Tutoring, looking for side gigs here and there and 
					working on my own projects. I started at 17 years old, definitely not a prodigy, but
					hey, being average ain't all that bad.
					</p>

					<h3>Things I'm good at</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
					Considering I used linux before I even learnt windows, I proudly call myself a linux wizard 
					(I use arch btw :P). From there I learnt basic web development, scripting, and a bit of low level
					programming. I also work as a computer technician, so I know my way around hardware and software
					issues. Or at least... how to google them.
					</p>
					<p>
					I absolutely love tinkering with things I have no idea about - I've bricked 4 phones, broken 2 laptops,
					and fried a raspberry pi. No regrets, I learnt a lot from those mistakes.
					</p>

					<ul class="skills">
						<li>Python</li>
						<li>HTML</li>
						<li>CSS</li>
						<li>JavaScript</li>
						<li>Linux</li>
						<li>C</li>
						<li>Bash Scripting</li>
						<li>Fingerstyle Guitar</li>
					</ul>

					<p>What. I'm a showoff. I love playing guitar</p>


					<h3>Things I'm bad at</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
					In case you didn't read my info, I suck at math. I'm also not the best at writing, but I'm working on it.
					Like most people, I am a terrible communicator. I fail to articulate my thoughts and ideas on the spot,
					so I prefer to write them down. Socializing has always been a bit of a challenge, although lately "Get
					out of your comfort zone" started making changes.
					</p>
